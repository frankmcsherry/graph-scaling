# Graph scaling

A testbed for evaluating the scaling properties of graph algorithms and infrastructure.

This project is designed to provide some measurement tools and methodology for evaluating the scaling properties of graph algorithms and infrastructure. Specifically, we are interested in when and why graph algorithms scale poorly. Initial result indicate that graph algorithms are not fundamentally bad at scaling, but that somewhere along the path from purely random graphs to "real world graphs" scaling falls over. We want to know where and why this happens.
